# Finetuning-Large-Language-Models
Learn to finetune an LLM in minutes and specialize it to use your data:
- Master LLM finetuning basics
- Differentiate finetuning from prompt engineering and know when to use each
- Gain hands-on experience with real datasets for your projects

Lab 1: In this lesson, you'll learn why you should fine-tune, and what 
fine-tuning is, comparing it to prompt engineering. Then go through the lab where you can 
compare a fine-tuned model to a non-fine-tuned model. 

Lab 2: In this lesson, you'll learn about where fine-tuning fits into the training process. 
It comes after a step called pre-training, which is explained in the lab. Then you'll get to learn about all the 
different tasks you get to apply fine-tuning to.

Lab 3: In this lesson, you'll learn about instruction fine-tuning, a variant of fine-tuning that enabled GPT-3 to turn into chat GPT and give it its chatting powers!
